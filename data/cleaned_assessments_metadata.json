It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development needs/limitations. The extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions to enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have demonstrated critical job behaviours. The PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and development situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of strength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work.

        "description": "The Reading Comprehension - English assessment provides a general measure of English reading comprehension. This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that you must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the candidate's ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions the candidate may be asked.",

By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others. 360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share. SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback. 360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
